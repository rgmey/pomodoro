"""Per-user WebSocket fan-out.

State is in memory, which is correct for a single API container and wrong for
more than one: a second replica would hold its own registry and a user
connected to replica A would never see an event published on replica B. If
this is ever scaled out, the broadcast has to go through Redis pub/sub (or
Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY) instead of this dict.
