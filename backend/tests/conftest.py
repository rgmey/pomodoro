"""Shared test fixtures.

Minimal by design: 1.2 needs a migrated test database to verify db.py, and
section 1.7 extends this with per-test transaction rollback and an
authenticated client fixture.

Tests run against a real Postgres, never SQLite — citext, the partial unique
index in 1.5 and the AT TIME ZONE bucketing in phase 3 are all Postgres-only,
and would pass or fail differently anywhere else.
